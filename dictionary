#  The DHCP dictionary is used only when the server is built with
#  "configure --with-dhcp".  It is not (and should not) be used in
#  other situations.  If you are running just a RADIUS server, this
#  line can be deleted.  If you are using DHCP, the following line
#  should be uncommented.
#
#  Ideally, the "configure" process should automatically enable this
#  dictionary, but we don't yet do that.

#$INCLUDE	/usr/local/dictionary.dhcp

#
#	The filename given here should be an absolute path. 
#
$INCLUDE	/usr/local/share/freeradius/dictionary

#
#	Place additional attributes or $INCLUDEs here.  They will
#	over-ride the definitions in the pre-defined dictionaries.
#
#	See the 'man' page for 'dictionary' for information on
#	the format of the dictionary files.

#
#	If you want to add entries to the dictionary file,
#	which are NOT going to be placed in a RADIUS packet,
#	add them here.  The numbers you pick should be between
#	3000 and 4000.

# 1.) If the user (Rd-User-Type) is authorized; check if the Rd-Mac-Check flag is 0 or 1.
# If it is 1; it means that the user can ONLY connect from devices (Calling-Station-Id) in his list
# So then we have to see if the Calling-Station-Id is included in the request and defined  a user
# and also if so; if there is a mac defined with this value User-Name=<mac> AND Rd-User-Type=device
# if so; we can go through auth using this device as the User-Name

#We also may want to apply a data counter on every device rather than the permanent user to which the devices belongs
#This is handy for a click-to connect login page
#Then we can also specify what hour a daily reset should happen. This again is also handy for hotels
